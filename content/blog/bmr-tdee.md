# Tracking Your Fitness Journey with BMR & TDEE

Off late, I‚Äôve been reading the book **"Lose Fat & Get Fitter"** by **Jitendra Chouksey**, and there‚Äôs a particular framework in it that really stood out to me. It simplifies how to track your fitness journey by focusing on two core concepts: **BMR** and **TDEE**.

## üß† What is BMR?

**BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** is the number of calories your body needs just to survive ‚Äî like if you stayed in bed all day, not moving at all. These are the calories used for basic functions like breathing, circulating blood, and cell repair.

## üßÆ Calculating BMR: The Harris-Benedict Formula

To track your BMR, we‚Äôll use the **Harris-Benedict formula**:

### For Women:

```
BMR = 655 + (9.6 √ó weight in kg) + (1.8 √ó height in cm) ‚àí (4.7 √ó age)
```

### For Men:

```
BMR = 66 + (13.7 √ó weight in kg) + (5 √ó height in cm) ‚àí (6.8 √ó age)
```

## üî• What is TDEE?

**TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** is the total number of calories your body burns in a day, including:

- Your BMR
- Physical activity
- Digestion
- Any other energy your body uses throughout the day

Once you know your **BMR**, you can calculate your **TDEE** by multiplying your BMR by an **Activity Multiplier**:

```
TDEE = BMR √ó Activity Multiplier
```

## üìä Activity Multiplier Table

To calculate your **TDEE**, multiply your BMR with the appropriate **Activity Factor** from the table below:

| Activity Level    | Description                           | Multiplier |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Sedentary         | Little or no exercise                 | 1.2        |
| Lightly active    | Light exercise/sports 1‚Äì3 days a week | 1.375      |
| Moderately active | Moderate exercise 3‚Äì5 days a week     | 1.55       |
| Very active       | Hard exercise 6‚Äì7 days a week         | 1.725      |
| Super active      | Very hard exercise + physical job     | 1.9        |

## üí° Example: Calculating TDEE

Let‚Äôs say your **BMR** is **1500 calories**, and you have a **sedentary lifestyle**. You get some exercise, but for the rest of the day, you're hacking away at your computer.

In this case, your **Activity Multiplier** would be **1.2** (Sedentary lifestyle).

Now, you can calculate your **TDEE**:

```
TDEE = 1500 √ó 1.2 = 1800 calories/day
```

So, to maintain your current weight, you‚Äôd need to consume around **1800 calories per day**.

---

## üìè Rule of Thumb

As you can see, if you exercise daily, your **TDEE** will be higher, which means you‚Äôll need more calories to maintain your weight. Here's the rule of thumb:

- **If you want to lose weight**: Consume calories **more than your BMR** but **less than your TDEE** (typically 10-20% less).
- **If you want to build muscle**: Consume **a bit more than your TDEE** (but don‚Äôt overconsume, lol!).
- **If you want to maintain weight**: Consume **equal to your TDEE**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Never Consume Calories Below Your BMR!

It's important to note that you should **never** consume calories below your **BMR**, as doing so can slow down your metabolism and cause other health issues.

üéâ Happy Fitness Journey!

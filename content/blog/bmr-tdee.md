### üöÄ **Track Your Fitness Journey with BMR & TDEE**

Lately, I‚Äôve been reading the book **"Lose Fat & Get Fitter"** by **Jitendra Chouksey**, and there's a particular framework that truly stood out. It simplifies how to track your fitness journey by focusing on two key concepts: **BMR** and **TDEE**.

---

#### üß† **What is BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)?**

**BMR** is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic functions, like breathing, circulating blood, and cell repair, while at rest. These are the calories you burn if you stayed in bed all day without moving.

---

#### üßÆ **How to Calculate BMR: The Harris-Benedict Formula**

We‚Äôll use the **Harris-Benedict formula** to calculate your **BMR**. Here‚Äôs how it works:

##### For Women:

```
BMR = 655 + (9.6 √ó weight in kg) + (1.8 √ó height in cm) ‚àí (4.7 √ó age)
```

##### For Men:

```
BMR = 66 + (13.7 √ó weight in kg) + (5 √ó height in cm) ‚àí (6.8 √ó age)
```

---

### üî• **What is TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)?**

**TDEE** represents the total number of calories your body burns in a day. It includes your **BMR**, physical activity, digestion, and any other energy your body uses throughout the day.

To calculate your **TDEE**, multiply your **BMR** by an **Activity Multiplier**:

```
TDEE = BMR √ó Activity Multiplier
```

---

### üìä **Activity Multiplier Table**

Use the following **Activity Multiplier** table to calculate your **TDEE** based on your activity level:

| **Activity Level**    | **Description**                       | **Multiplier** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Sedentary**         | Little or no exercise                 | 1.2            |
| **Lightly active**    | Light exercise/sports 1‚Äì3 days a week | 1.375          |
| **Moderately active** | Moderate exercise 3‚Äì5 days a week     | 1.55           |
| **Very active**       | Hard exercise 6‚Äì7 days a week         | 1.725          |
| **Super active**      | Very hard exercise + physical job     | 1.9            |

---

### üí° **Example: Calculating Your TDEE**

Let's say your **BMR** is **1500 calories** and you have a **sedentary lifestyle**. Even though you do some exercise occasionally, most of your day involves sitting at your desk.

Your **Activity Multiplier** will be **1.2** (for a Sedentary lifestyle).

Now, calculate your **TDEE**:

```
TDEE = 1500 √ó 1.2 = 1800 calories/day
```

To maintain your current weight, you would need to consume **around 1800 calories per day**.

---

### üìè **Rule of Thumb for Caloric Intake**

Depending on your goals, here's a simple rule of thumb for how to adjust your calorie intake:

- **Want to lose weight?** Consume **fewer calories than your TDEE** (typically 10‚Äì20% less).
- **Want to build muscle?** Consume **slightly more than your TDEE** (but avoid overconsumption).
- **Want to maintain weight?** Consume **equal to your TDEE**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning: Never Consume Below Your BMR!**

It‚Äôs essential that you **never** consume fewer calories than your **BMR**, as this can slow down your metabolism and lead to other health issues.

üéâ **Happy Fitness Journey!** Keep tracking, stay consistent, and enjoy the progress!

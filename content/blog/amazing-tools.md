One very handy open-source tool I came across recently is [GitDiagram](https://gitdiagram.com). 🚀

It helps me visualize complex code architectures — making it super easy to understand and work with even the most intricate projects. 💡

What’s really impressive is that GitDiagram uses o3-mini to infer the visualization diagram from the project structure, and PostgreSQL to cache the diagrams for lightning-fast access. ⚡ Plus, the developer has generously hosted it for free! 🙌

Big shoutout to [Ahmed Khaleel](https://github.com/ahmedkhaleel2004) for building and maintaining this awesome gem. 🔥 The project is open source and available [here on GitDiagram](https://gitdiagram.com) if you’re curious. 👨‍💻

**Note:** To see the visualizations, simply replace "GitHub" with "GitDiagram" in your repo URL. 😉

Here’s the diagram of my blogpost repository, which I'm using for this post:

_Happy Learning!_ 🎉
